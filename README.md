# Operation Won
## Introduction
Built on the Flutter SDK, Operation Won is an app designed to transform your mobile phone into a walkie-talkie with the use of headphones. By using Agora and Flutter Audio Service, Operation Won is designed for in-person meetings which may seperate people from each other.

## Features
Opertion Won is a basic, easy-to-use application, and has features such as:
- Push-to-talk (PTT) on earbuds by pausing/resuming audio stream.
- Good audio quality with low latency.
- Based off on an internet connection, allowing for an extensive range.

## Installation
For now, Operation Won can only be installed on Anroid via downloading and installing .apk files. This file will be provided upon the release of v1.0.0.

Unfortunately, I cannot release OpWon on iOS. If you wish to install the app on iOS, you'll have to do so on your own means via Xcode. A tutorial on this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4952820/test-ios-app-on-device-without-apple-developer-program-or-jailbreak).

Operation Won is not meant for nor developed for MacOS or Windows but hey, no one's not stopping you. Simply clone the repository and run the main app. <br>
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Infinity6542/Operation-Won
